Welcome to fomo! We love social media so much we made a game out of it!

To play, open the processing file titled "FOMO6" and click the play ">" button near the upper left corner.

The game may take a few seconds to load. 
Once the homepage appears, please allow a few seconds for the game to finish loading before pressing SPACE to start the game.
If the spacebar does not work initially, try pressing the "play" button again.

Click on the thumbs up facebook 'like' icons with the cursor to collect "likes". 
Be sure to get those 'likes' before they leave the screen or GAME OVER!

Drag and drop horizontally-floating 'posts' to thier corresponding social media site in one of the fours corners of the window to collect "friends" and/or "followers".
While you are dragging the post, the correct site's logo will be outlined.
Be sure to get those 'posts' before they exit the screen, or else it will be gone forever.
Be sure to keep your social media presence balanced, and do not lose too many 'posts' for one site or GAME OVER.

Collect as many 'likes', and post as many 'posts' as possible to gain more "people who love and adore you"!
